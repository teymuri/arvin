# Let

## Comments
Comments in Let are written using `(` and `)` tokens. Let will ignore every thing between left and right parentheses. There is no different comment syntax for inline or block comments (spread over multiple lines). 
Nested comment blocks are also valid.

```
(this is a comment line)

(comments could as well 
be spread over 
multiple lines)

(also (nested (comment blocks) are) valid)
