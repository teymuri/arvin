# Let

## Comments
Comments in Let are written using `(` and `)` tokens. Let will ignore
every thing between a left and it's corresponding right
parenthesis. There is no different comment syntax for inline or block
comments (spread over multiple lines).  Nested comment blocks are also
valid.

```
(this is a comment line)

(comments could as well 
be spread over 
multiple lines)

(also (nested (comment blocks) are) valid)
```
