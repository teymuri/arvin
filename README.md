## Commenting
Comments in Let are done using `(` and `)` tokens. Let will ignore every thing inbetween left and right parentheses. There is no different comment syntax for inline or block comments. 
Nested comment blocks are also valid.

```
(this is a comment line)

(comments could as well 
be spread over 
multiple lines)

(also (nested (comment blocks) are) valid)
```
