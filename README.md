## Commenting
Comments in let are done using () tokens. Let will ignore every thing inbetween left and right parentheses. There is no different comment syntax for inline or block comments. 
Nested comment blocks are also valid.

```
(this is a commented line)

(comments can 
also spread over 
multiple lines)

(also (nested (comment blocks) are) valid!)
```
