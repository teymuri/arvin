# Let

## Comments
Comments in Let are written using `(` and `)` tokens. Let will ignore
every thing between a left and it's corresponding right
parenthesis. There is no different comment syntax for inline or block
comments (spread over multiple lines).  Nested comment blocks are also
valid.

(comments could as well 
be spread over 
multiple lines)

(also (nested (comment blocks) are) valid)
